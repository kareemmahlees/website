Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. _Italic_, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

- this one
- that one
- the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.

> They can span multiple paragraphs,

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. â˜º

```go title="src/main.go" {1-2}  /fmt.prinlnt/ caption="figure 1 90 repssdf alksdjfkj"
func main(){
  fmt.prinlnt("askdfjkladsjkf aslkdfjkalsdfjklasjdfkldasjfkljdfaslkdfjkalsdfjklasjdfkldasjfkljdfaslkdfjkalsdfjklasjdfkldasjfkljdfaslkdfjkalsdfjklasjdfkldasjfkljdfaslkdfjkalsdfjklasjdfkldasjfkljdf")
}
```

## An h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

1.  first item
2.  second item
3.  third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

### An h3 header

Now a nested list:

1.  First, get these ingredients:

    - carrots
    - celery
    - lentils

2.  Boil some water.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Tables can look like this:

size material color

---

9 leather brown
10 hemp canvas natural
11 glass transparent

Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of

(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports
multi-line tables:

---

keyword text

---

red Sunsets, apples, and
other red or reddish
things.

green Leaves, grass, frogs
and other things it's
not easy being.

---

A horizontal rule follows.

---

Here's a definition list:

apples
: Good for making applesauce.
oranges
: Citrus!
tomatoes
: There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term/definition pair to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block":

| Line one
| Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

Inline math equations go in like so: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
